# Video pipeline for event-based sensors


This project presents a video pipeline that allows processing the information provided by an event-based camera. For this purpose, a heterogeneous architecture using FPGA co-processing together with a general purpose processor has been created. On other hand, an abstraction library has been created too to provide an extra layer between the user and the architecture, facilitating the use of the pipeline. 

The main purpose of this project is allow researchers and engineers to work with this kind of asynchronous sensor in a easier and faster way, focusing only on develop them algorithms, without worrying about the internal working of the sensor or its later visualitation. 

**Documentation is being finalized, but the code is complete. Thanks for your patient.**
